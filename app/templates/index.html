    <div class="about-me-content">
      <p>
        I am a passionate, driven, and resolute Full Stack Software Engineer and ardent learner with an innate passion
        for
        continuous learning and innovation. My journey into programming began at an early age through an enrichment
        program at Northwestern University, where I completed robotics and Scratch I & II courses. That’s when I
        discovered the immense joy I derive from building and creating.
      </p>

      <p>I’m enamored by the versatility of technology and the ability to instruct a computer to bring ideas to
        life
        through websites, applications, games, and many more limitless opportunities. My love for tech was reignited by
        my hobby of crocheting.
        Both
        crocheting and coding begin with a blank slate and limited resources, demanding critical thinking, imagination,
        and creativity to produce a tangible result. Crochet patterns are like algorithms, just as programs are
        implemented algorithms.</p>

      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy international travel, crocheting, photography, reading, gaming, and I’ve
        developed basic proficiency in Korean through reading, writing, and speaking. These experiences have shaped my
        leadership and creative abilities.
      </p>

      <p>Creation and helping others are the two overarching interests in my life. Learning and working with software
        are
        the
        first steps toward making a meaningful impact on both the tech industry and society. My goal is to positively
        impact people’s lives through technology and innovation.</p>
